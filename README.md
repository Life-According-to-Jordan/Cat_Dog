Here is my Convolutional Neural Net,CNN, image classifier for cats and dogs. 

The data was collected from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).

Also, huge shoutout to Siraj Raval for always keeping Data Science and Computer Science interesting. Here is his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAICT4Al5Ow) covering this topic!
