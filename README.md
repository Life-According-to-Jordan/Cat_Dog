# Cat_Dog
Here is my Convolutional Neural Net, CNN, image classifier for cats and dogs. 

The data was collected from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).

Also, huge shoutout to Siraj Raval for always keeping Data Science and Computer Science interesting. Here is his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAICT4Al5Ow) covering this topic!

### CNN Model

### Accuracy Score - Final Model with Data Augmentation
![Augmented Findal Model](https://github.com/Life-According-to-Jordan/Cat_Dog/blob/master/Final_graph.png)

After 30 epochs on 20,000 training images, the model's accuracy is near 87.5%.

After 30 epochs on 20,000 training images, with data augmentation, the model's accuracy is near 91%.
